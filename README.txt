Instructions and Notes:
Just type 'make' and then run the project1 executable to run the server.
Use telnet to interface with the SMTP server and play around with the.

I implemented return code 251 for when you are sending emails to non-local individuals.
The mboxes created for @localhost addresses can be read by the Unix mail command (mail -f <filename>).
I also allowed it so you can type in the forward and reverse paths with brackets (<>) or spaces after the command (i.e. MAIL FROM: <..> or MAIL FROM: ...).
I tested the relaying of mail against my Mines account. I couldn't think of another place to test it since most (i.e. Gmail) require TLS and that wasn't a requirement of the assignment.
